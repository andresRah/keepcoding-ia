El sistema debe proporcionar especificaciones detalladas de la cerveza, posibles acompañamientos, y otra información relevante sobre la cerveza o cervezas en general, utilizando el ranking mundial consultado en internet. Además, los usuarios podrán consultar si una cerveza específica está disponible en el bar y, si no desean cerveza, el chatbot ofrecerá opciones de otros licores y cócteles."

This isn't to say that Jack Daniel's Honey is bad, but merely that it is very off-center for its type. I really have to wonder if the whiskey used wasn't aged in used oak or barely aged at all, and that strong maple character didn't come from the Lincoln County Process. In the United States, this liqueur typically costs $20 or $22. The process of making Jack Daniel's Honey involves blending the original Jack Daniel's Old No. 7 with a proprietary honey liqueur.

The first whiff definitely smells like Jack Daniels, with its characteristic charred wood and corn notes, but much sweeter. A taste enhances that perception: the sweetness becomes even more apparent and definitely honey-like, and the whiskey notes move further to the background, but keep it from being cloyingly sweet. Primary Tastes. Jack Daniel's whiskey has a smooth and sweet taste with notes of caramel and vanilla. It has a slight smokiness that comes from being filtered through charcoal made from sugar maple wood. The sweetness comes from the use of corn in the mash bill.
